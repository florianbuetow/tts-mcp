# Development Rules for mistral-text-to-spech

This file provides guidance to AI agents and AI-assisted development tools when working with this project. This includes Claude Code, Cursor IDE, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and any other AI coding assistants.

## General Coding Principles
- **Fail fast — never swallow errors.** Always propagate errors and exit with code 1 immediately. No silent fallbacks, no `|| true`, no ignored return codes.
- **Never assume any default values anywhere.** Check for required values explicitly and exit 1 if something is missing. Default values mask underlying issues and make them hard to debug.
- **Never suppress checks with annotations.** Fix the underlying issue instead. No `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `# nosec`, `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings`, or any other mechanism that silences a checker.
- Always be explicit about values, paths, and configurations
- If a value is not provided, raise an error — never silently fall back to a default

## Git Commit Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** When creating git commits in this repository:
- **NEVER include AI attribution in commit messages**
- **NEVER add "Generated with [AI tool name]" or similar phrases**
- **NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: [AI name]" or similar attribution**
- **NEVER run `git add -A` or `git add .` - always stage files explicitly**
- Keep commit messages professional and focused on the changes made
- Commit messages should describe what changed and why, without mentioning AI assistance
- **ALWAYS run `git push` after creating a commit to push changes to the remote repository**
- **NEVER use `git -C <path>`** — always run git commands from the project root directory

## Testing
- After **every change** to the code, the tests must be executed
- Always verify the program runs correctly with `just chat` after modifications

## Python Execution Rules
- Python code must be executed **only** via `uv run ...`
  - Example: `uv run src/main.py`
  - **Never** use: `python src/main.py` or `python3 src/main.py`
- The virtual environment must be created and updated **only** via `uv sync`
  - **Never** use: `pip install`, `python -m pip`, or `uv pip`
- All dependencies must be managed through `uv` and declared in `pyproject.toml`

## Justfile Conventions
- **Use `printf` for colored or formatted output** — never `echo` with ANSI escape sequences, as some terminals won't render colors with `echo`. Plain `echo ""` is acceptable only for blank-line spacing.
- **Add an empty `@echo ""` line before and after each target's command block** to visually separate output between targets.
- **The `help` target must be a dedicated recipe** with manually written `printf` lines that group related commands and order them by typical execution flow (setup → run → code quality → testing). Never use `just --list`.
- **The default target (`_default`) must call `just help`.**
- **Every target must end with a clear status message**: green (`\033[32m`) on success, red (`\033[31m`) on failure with `exit 1`.
- **Composite targets (e.g. `ci`) must fail fast**: use `set -e` or `&&` chaining.
- All Python execution in the justfile uses `uv run`, never `python` directly
- Use `just init` to set up the project
- Use `just chat` to run the interactive chat
- Use `just serve` to start the FastAPI TTS server (foreground)
- Use `just stop` to stop the running server
- Use `just status` to check if the server is running
- Use `just destroy` to remove the virtual environment
- Use `just help` to see all available recipes with descriptions
- Use `just` (with no arguments) to show help
- Use `just ci` to run all validation checks (verbose)
- Use `just ci-quiet` to run all validation checks (silent, fail-fast)

## Project Structure
- All source code lives in `src/`
- Test scripts and utilities go in `scripts/`
- **Input data is organized**: `data/input/`
- **Output data is organized**: `data/output/`
- **Never create Python files in the project root directory**
  - Wrong: `./test.py`, `./helper.py`
  - Correct: `./src/helper.py`, `./scripts/test.py`

## Error Handling
- Fail fast — stop immediately on the first error, never continue past failures
- Never catch and silently ignore exceptions
- Raise exceptions with clear messages for missing or invalid data
- Exit with code 1 if any operation fails, 0 if all succeeded

## Optimization
- **Skip processing if output already exists** - Don't reprocess unnecessarily
- Check if output file exists before starting expensive operations
- Track skipped items separately in summary reports
- Allow users to force reprocessing by deleting output files
